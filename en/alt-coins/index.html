<p>Bitcoin was the category creator of crypto-currency and got everyone excited with huge movements in the <a href="/en/bitcoin-price/">Bitcoin price</a>. With the initial innovation has come an explosion of <em></em>'alt-coins'</em>. Bitcoin is considered a SHA-256 coin because it uses that algorithm for its <em></em>proof of work</em> component.</

<p>Other alt-coins use different algorithms such as scrypt, X11, X13, X15, NIST5 and 100% proof of stake. Often the developers of alt-coins are seeking to develop some new innovation that makes it more useful to market participants. Alt-coins have traditionally been extremely volatile in price which seems to draw speculators.</p>
