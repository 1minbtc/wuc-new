<p>When the <a href="/en/bitcoin-price/">Bitcoin price</a> goes up and Bitcoin becomes more popular then more charlatans and schemers come out of the woodwork purporting to be bitcoin experts. Sifting the noise to hone in on the signal of an experienced, trustworthy, knowledgeable and credible bitcoin expert can be incredibly difficult.

<p><strong>Bitcoin Security</strong> is the foundation upon which all other Bitcoin activity is built upon.

<p>The best bitcoin exchanges are built on a solid foundation of bitcoin security. hundreds of millions of dollars of bitcoins have been lost from cybersecurity intrusions against bitcoin exchanges. If you use a Bitcoin exchange then you will want to make sure they are honest, trustworthy and competent.

<p>Once you have learned about Bitcoin, figured out how to operate a Bitcoin wallet, acquired and secured some bitcoins then you will probably want to figure out how to earn or spend bitcoins.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.bitcoin.kn/2015/01/btck-128-2015-01-24/">Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast Episode 128</a> Chairman and Founder of <a href="https://www.bitpay.com/">Bitpay</a> Tony Gallippi is interviewed about running the premier <a href="/bitcoin-merchant-processor/">Bitcoin merchant processor</a> with tens of thousands of merchants including Microsoft, Virgin Galatic, Shopify, TigerDirect, Namecheap, Newegg and tens of thousands others.
<p>Merchants have every reason to accept Bitcoin using a reputable, solvent and competent merchant processor because there are 0% fees, no PCI compliance costs, no fraud, no chargebacks and all exchange rate risk can be allocated to the merchant processor with daily fiat currency direct deposits.</p>
