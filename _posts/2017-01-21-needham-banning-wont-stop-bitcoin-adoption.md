<p><a href="/rich-famous-bitcoin/">Economic and Financial Turmoil</a> Driving Bitcoin Interest & Adoption - this is the title of the note circulated by Needham & Company LLC on Thursday.  It tackles the  variety of signs which they believe that would push the increase of Bitcoin adoption onward which includes demonetization, capital controls, hyperinflation and last but not least, Bitcoin bans. </p>

<p>Looking at the perspective, it could be having negativity on first glance but the firm stands with the belief that they will bring Bitcoin interest to the next level.</p>

<p>Needham & Company LLC is well known to be focused on growth companies which made them recognized in <a href="/confidential-transactions/">asset management</a> and investment banking in national level.</p>

<h2>There's No Point On Banning Bitcoin</h2>

<p>Spencer Bogart - author and <a href="/why-use-bitcoin/">analyst of Needham</a> discussed about some countries who strongly reject and ban Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Even if that move isn't in favor of the Bitcoin adoption, they can't either stop it also.</p>

<p>He raised Bangladesh as an example particularly the Central Bank's which on September of 2014 jailed offenders for twelve years to impose Bitcoin ban.  With that kind of scenario, the country still on top to be number 7 globally in terms of topmost Bitcoin interest.</p>

<p>He also added : The most topic being queried over a proxied internet research were activity being imposed in Ponzi schemes - scams or regulatory news. </p>

<p>On the same hand, Bolivia (banned BTC in mid of 2014), also triggered spikes in the graphs in terms of Bitcoin interest and ranks overall as number eight for relevant search terms.</p>

<p>This unbelievable pheonomenon of <a href="/bitcoin-trading-with-binary-options/">Bitcoin interest</a> explained by Bogart as the Streisand effect, which is the censorship of one thing has consequences and that strictness draws more interest by the citizens itself. Curiosity is the right term for that one.</p>

<h2>Additional Factors Draws Bitcoin Adoption</h2>

<p>More factors like demonetization, capital controls and hyperinflation also fuels the rising on Bitcoin interests and worldwide adoption as per Bogart's discussion.</p>

<p>He site India as an example after banning Bitcoin's large bills on November, Bitcoin's interest burst into the internet which is four times the number of the last time it has been counted before the ban. The trading volume become massive and Bitcoion usage tripled.</p>

<p>When the inflation rate of 19% which doubles over the past year in Nigeria, there is a massive search interest for BTC within the country, he added. Categorically, same thing happen to Venezuela when the hyperflation of 180%+ problem occurred.</p>

<p>In his note, he strongly stated that while other countries opted Bitcoin banning, citizens becoming more and more interested on Bitcoin options. One concrete example are the ticket Kiosks in Switzerland's National Swiss Railway which is scattered over the country and has the ability to buy Bitcoins.</p>

<p>The note also discuss about US which is trailing other twenty countries in Bitcoin interest over internet search queries. Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur), Nigeria (Lagos), Venezuela (Caracas) and South Africa (Sandton) all also exceed the Bitcoin interest from New York and Sanfrancisco, note detailed.  </p>
