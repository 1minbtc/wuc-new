<p>In terms of Bitcoin, people tend to be more cautious particularly on privacy, and that is because their government disagrees on the type of exchange they are dealing with. Gambling sites also is one of the reason why some Bitcoin users were prompted when by <a href="/confidential-transactions/">Bitcoin-related business</a>.</p>

<p>Carrying Satoshis into the laundry - are one of the various techniques and pointers that this article is going to tackle about.</p>

<h2 id="tumbling">Why Tumbling Bitcoins Necessary? </h2>

<p>There have been <a href="/how-use-bitcoin-anonymously/">forum complaints recently</a> about Coinbase being used in gambling sites and it's already been happen for years. A strong statement from Coinbase that they are firm on what has been stated in their user agreement and it is not acceptable to use site like that. </p>

<p>Dark Net users also who visited marketplaces are not just being prompted by some Bitcoin service providers but also having the high risk of imprisonment for criminal penalties.</p>

<p>Safety measure should be observe when using DNM or Dark Net Markets and gambling sites by having anonymity profile and public blockchain. There are lots of methods of how to become anonymous, one of it is by hiding IP addresses, or using Virtual Private Network or using incognito browsers.</p>

<p>On the above options, we will be tackling about another way of <a href="/bitcoin-privacy-technologies-zerocash-confidential-transactions/">privacy called coin tumbling</a>, coin shuffling or coinjoin. Some altcoins also perform this method natively on every transaction but we will just be focusing on tumbling using Bitcoins.</p>

<p>Like a set of deck of cards, Bitcoin tumbling platform will be shuffling multiple transactions together with the assurance of everyone gets back their money while being cast in the shadow.</p>

<p>Lots of websites offers that kind of method where they will be mixing your BTC on the clearnet by using Tor in the hidden web for example. Example of those site are :</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Bitmix</li>
<li>2. Bitlaundry</li>
<li>3. Blockchain[dot]info</li>
<li>4. Bitcoinlaundry</li>
</ul>
<p>They have interfaces that offers mixing of coin services. Then Dark Net Markets like Alphabay and Dream Market also having the tumblers on their  shops and many more offers the same services that you can found in the deep web.</p>

<h2 id="mix">How To Mix Coins Using Hidden Web</h2>

<p>For those who are interested in safe guarding more on their transactions, deep web has also manifold layers of obfuscation.  You just have to send Bitcoins into a certain wallet who uses clearnet and also creating a wallet with a cloak of Tor using Electrum.</p>

<p>The second method is by sending using the hidden web of Bitcoin you need to mix from a clearnet wallet to the one newly created. This process added another layer of confusion and is called the first hop.</p>

<p>After that, you can create few more wallets using the wallet you created over Tor and depending on the privacy you want to implement for the hops you want to establish.</p>

<p>Finally, certain users can just trust Bitcoin mixing services by doing precautions that the URL being used is One Hundred percent correct.</p>

<p>Some of the mixing services are considerable in terms of fees and yes, most of them will charge you for using their platform to do mixing services. When you are interested on premium fees, then you can get a very good layer of anonymity services. Some phishing and scam site are also around the web so you have to be very vigilant on the right URL you are working on.</p>

<p>After mixing of those coins, you should be able to send those Bitcoins to addresses created by Tor and most of the people are suggesting that sending it to multiple addresses is way more safety than just one. Hence, the above is just left as your freedom of choice for whatever convenience you have to part take in terms of protecting your privacy.</p>

<p>One thing also needs to be considered is when someone enters a wrong information. Previously, one user just sent 291 BTC after tumbling. New users don't usually send that large of amount but it happens to ordinary users.</p>

<p>Securing every details specially entering fees rates and URLs is the best way to get you out of trouble.</p>

<h2 id="secure">Bitcoin Tumbling Isn't One Hundred Percent Secure</h2>

<p>One thing for sure these days is that there's no cryptographic framework or even software that is one hundred percent anonymous. Users can fool around with various altcoins like Monero and Dash if they are convince that these tokens are more safer in dealing with transactions.</p>

<p>Ring signatures has been used by Monero while Dash is based on <a href="/bitcoin-vpns/">Coinjoin protocol mixing method</a>, both of them shuffles tokens in a completely different manner. But even this ideal privacy services of altcoins arenâ€™t enough and very well known combination services for Bitcoins like JoinMarket which is known to be weak.</p>

<p>VPN or Virtual Private Network is one way of protecting privacy of users when doing transactions or splitting funds towards multiple addresses. Recently, BitCluster has ben spotted as tracker for user's activity if one address has been a recipient even after tumbling, software creator says.</p>

<p>On the otherhand, companies like Chainalysis and Elliptic are creating protocols that enables the monitoring of Bitcoin blockchain on not legal activities.</p>
