Segregated Witness is a proposal by Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille. It uses a new data type to decrease the amount of data stored for each Bitcoin transaction. As a result, more transactions will fit into each block. Wuille’s Segregated Witness (or SegWit) allows for a practical increase in block space without the need for a hardfork. 

In addition to scalability improvements, Segregated Witness helps with transaction malleability and decreases the cost to run a full node since less data needs to be stored. For more details, [listen to this interview](http://www.bitcoin.kn/2016/01/ciphrex-ceo-eric-lombrozo-discusses-the-live-segregated-witness-test-net/) with Eric Lombrozo, or [read this explainer](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/segregated-witness-part-how-a-clever-hack-could-significantly-increase-bitcoin-s-potential-1450553618). 

The following list tracks wallets, exchanges, miners, and other Bitcoin companies that plan to implement Segregated Witness.

### Initial Announcement

Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core dev and contributor to SegWit, [announced on the bitcoin-dev mailing list](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-January/012195.html) that a number of wallets have already expressed support for SegWit: mSIGNA, GreenAddress, GreenBits, Blocktrail, and NBitcoin.

### Ledger

Nicolas Bacca (btchip), an employee of Bitcoin security company Ledger, [announced support](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40bcf8/which_wallets_are_working_on_compatibility_with/cysx0mx) for SegWit on reddit:

“We (Ledger) will be working on it soon - the changes to support SegWit are quite limited so I expect every hardware wallet to be compatible with it quickly.”
 
### breadwallet

Aaron Voisine is the CEO and founder of breadwallet, perhaps the most popular Bitcoin wallet for iPhone. In an [interview with Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/breadwallet-ceo-aaron-voisine-we-support-core-s-scalability-road-map-but-bitcoin-does-need-a-hard-fork-1452545148), Voisine stated that breadwallet will support SegWit.
