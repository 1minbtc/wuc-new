<p>Follow these eight steps to learn how to use the <a href="/armory/">Armory</a> multi-sig lockboxes with <a href="/coinkite/">Coinkite</a>.
<p><b>First</b>, create a new Multisig Vault. I will be using a 2-of-3 Vault for this tutorial.
<p><b>Second</b>, generate the three keys. When generating the keys, record the HD Wallet string to a safe location. Do this for each key generated.
<p><b>Third</b>, once the Multisig Vault is created, go to BIP32.org and click on the BIP32 Key button where you should enter the first HD Wallet string you copied into the extended Key Box.
<p><b>Fourth</b>, scroll down and change the Derivation Path to simple.
<p><b>Fifth</b>, then copy the Public Key (Hex) to a safe location and repeat for the remaining keys.
<p><b>Sixth</b>, open Armory and create a new Lockbox and make sure the M-of-N is the same as Coinkite's.
<p><b>Seventh</b>, enter the public key (hex) that was copied earlier in the same order that their HD wallet strings were entered and generated into Coinkite.
<p>Finally, as you can see, the multisig addresses match. CONGRATS! You have imported your Coinkite Multisig Vault into a Bitcoin Armory Multisig Lockbox.
