<p>The blocksize limit is what ensures everyone can participate in the Bitcoin network, and it ensures everyone can participate anonymously should they choose too. Some people want to remove this protection to make Bitcoin scale, but we can have the best of both worlds: high transaction volume and true decentralization with off-chain transactions.
