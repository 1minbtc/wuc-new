<p>WeUseCoins and Bitcoin Mining offer some of the highest quality traffic in the Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency niche. To ensure sustainability we accept advertising and sponsorship.
<p><h2>RATES</h2>
<p>We can be very flexible with whatever type of campaign you want to run. Almost all legal business will be considered although some niches will not. The site needs to be family friendly and professional. All advertising sponsorships must be paid in advance via Bitcoin.
<p>Although spots can be custom tailored the rates will be similar to Coindesk:

<p>We prefer to do larger deals for a longer time and will offer discounts for such.
<p><b>SMALL</b> In order to make efficient use of administrative time the smallest campaign would be a banner at the top of a single page that averages about 10,000 impressions per month would cost about $150.
<p><b>LARGE</b> If a large site-wide campaign were wanted then for the footer slot above the black email box on both sites would generate about 360,000 impressions per month and cost about $9,000.
<p><b>LARGE and LONG</b> If you wanted to buy out the premier header banner spot (directly beneath the navigation bar and demoed on this page) for a 6 month period on both sites then we would probably do a deal for around $60,000. Talk about great exposure for your business!
<p><h2>CONTACT</h2>
<p>If you are serious, a minimum $5,000 campaign paid in advance via bitcoins, about sponsoring with some advertising then please send an email with <b>(1)</b> what type of campaign you want to run, <b>(2)</b> where you would like the banners to appear and <b>(3)</b> your suggested rate.
<p>We are also willing to do a content partnership or some other creative option you may want to discuss. We are easy to work with and commercially reasonable.
