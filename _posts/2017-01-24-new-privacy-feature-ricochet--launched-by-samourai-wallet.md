<p>"Frustrate spies and improve fungibility" - that how the <a href="/how-to-keep-your-bitcoin-privacy-and-security-online/">developers and creators of Samurai</a> - a private centric wallet for their new feature of their product and services</p>

<h2>Samourai's New Revelation - Transaction Hop Service Premium Bitcoin </h2>

<p>Primary objectives of the creators of the <a href="/how-banks-can-benefit-from-blockchain/">Bitcoin wallet named Samourai</a> is the fungibility and Bitcoin privacy which they have launched on spring of 2015. It is an Android-based wallet that has AES-256 - a military kind of encryption and only the owner can keep it in hand. </p>

<p>The developers recently named Ricochet as a feature that adds 4 hops in addition to a transaction. The team of Samourai iterates that there are thousands of transactions everyday that has been blacklisted with blockchain spies.</p>

<p>"Bitcoin banks and trades solidify supports and suspend clients in view of boycotts distributed by blockchain spies," clarifies the <a href="/bitcoin-cold-storage/">Samourai engineers</a>. "Blockchain spies take a gander at the historical backdrop of your coins around five bounces profound. </p>

<p>Your coins can be solidified for their past action. Regardless of the possibility that they weren't in your control. </p>

<p>Ricochet adds four extra bounces to an exchange—by including extra jumps before the coins achieve their last goal, the blockchain spies would need to look ten jumps in reverse, expanding their expenses and overheads."</p>

<h2>A New Technique To Earn A Wallet Project</h2>

<p>There are lots of questions before how <a href="/bitcoin-privacy-technologies-zerocash-confidential-transactions/">Bitcoin wallet companies</a> offering free services can sustain in their business.  One user comment on Reddit says how interesting feature and method that a little wallet firm can earn a wallet without moving in to an ICO scam. Which he thinks that it is the type of implementation that developer should follow.</p>

<p>In reply to that, Samourai developers actually said that their approach is similar to what has been in the comment and that they don’t want to push users towards KYC or Know Your Customers merchants. On this reply of the Samourai team, commentators reacted and didn’t appreciate gallant characterization of other wallet creators. </p>

<p>Samourai give details that they have not anything personal in opposition to these developers monetizing in this way. It is just a bit on which the company will never give and take.</p>

<p>Samourai developers says they don't see any useful means to implement KYC functionality. Those who opposes the idea have a lot of options to take on. For the moment they aren't interested on monetizing the services.</p>

<h2>Samourai Wants to Control The Booming Environment of Spying Blockchain</h2>

<p>Some businesses find blockchain spying to be more efficient and significance for the past two years in tracing their services. If there's something wrong with the transactions, these businesses can freeze BTC accounts specially if they detect transaction hops. The Samourai developers think of it as Bitcoin privacy problem.</p>

<p>Ricochet collects the inputs and miner fees needed for the transaction, and the user also pays 0.001 BTC to Samourai to process the ricocheted transaction. Each hop transaction maintains one input and one output with the final transaction. The team explains the process does not eliminate blacklisting entirely but “fungibility is preserved by moving funds to an address out of the line-of-sight of ill-intentioned actors.”</p>

<h2>Privacy Activism at the Forefront</h2>

<p>Since the Samourai wallet was presented, the venture has constantly centered around security and trusts it is a successor to the to a great extent surrendered Dark Wallet extend. The group has added various components to the stage, similar to the capacity to swipe the application off the telephone from a remote area. The group views themselves as activists determined to give a more fungible bitcoin encounter for clients.</p>

<p>"We are protection activists who have devoted our lives to making the product that Silicon Valley will never construct, the controllers will never permit, and the VC's will never put resources into. We construct the product that Bitcoin merits," peruses the Samourai engineer's witticism.</p>
