Factom is a way to record entries in a way that makes the list unique (everyone gets the same copy) and allows anyone to add to the list, but does not allow anyone to change entries once they are in the list.

Factom is a method of creating an immutable audit trail. It is also a mechanism to communicate changes in a system. If your application needs a central server to coordinate processes, you might be able to eliminate the central server in favor of using Factom.

You can use Factoids (the Factom currency) to purchase Entry Credits with a simple transaction. The protocol does the conversion, so you effectively purchase the Entry Credits from the protocol. You assign those Entry Credits to a public key.
<p>
Factom is a distributed, decentralized protocol running on top of Bitcoin. That means nobody controls it, but that it is software that people all over the world run to make the protocol work. But the software is open source, and anyone is free to use it for any purpose.
