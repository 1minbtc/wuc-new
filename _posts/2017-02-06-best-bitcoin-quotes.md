<blockquote><p>In 1999, Professor Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize winner in economics stated:</p>
<p>“I think the internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that’s missing but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash.”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>– Hal Finney</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Bitcoin enables certain uses that are very unique. I think it offers possibilities that no other currency allows.

<p><strong>– Pieter Wuille</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Hey, obviously this is a very interesting time to be in Bitcoin right now, but if you guys want to argue over whether this is reality or not, one Bitcoin will feed over 40 homeless people in Pensacola right now. If you guys want proof Bitcoin is real, send them to me, I’ll cash them out and feed homeless people.”</p>

<p><strong>– Amir Taaki</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“When I first heard about Bitcoin, I thought it was impossible. How can you have a purely digital currency? Can’t I just copy your hard drive and have your bitcoins? I didn’t understand how that could be done, and then I looked into it and it was brilliant”</p>
<p><strong>– Jeff Garzik</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“As the value goes up, heads start to swivel and skeptics begin to soften. Starting a new currency is easy, anyone can do it. The trick is getting people to accept it, because it is their use that gives the “money” value.”</p>
<p><strong>– Adam B. Levine</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>– Peter Diamandis</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Cryptocurrency Protocols Are Like Onions… One common design philosophy among many cryptocurrency 2.0 protocols is the idea that, just like the internet, cryptocurrency design would work best if protocols split off <p>into different layers. Under this strain of thought, Bitcoin is to be thought of as a sort of TCP/IP of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and other next-generation protocols can be built on top of Bitcoin much like we have SMTP for email, HTTP for webpages and XMPP for chat all on top of TCP as a common underlying data layer.”</p>
<p><strong>– Vitalik Buterin</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“The bitcoin world is this new ecosystem where it doesn’t cost that much to start a new bitcoin company, it doesn’t cost much to start owning bitcoin either, and it is a much more efficient way of moving money around the world.”</p>
<p><strong>– Tim Draper</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“I love seeing new services constantly starting to accept Bitcoin. Bitcoin is really becoming “the currency of the Internet.” I’m most concerned by possible government reactions to Bitcoin. They can’t destroy Bitcoin, but they could really slow things down by making exchange much more difficult.”</p>
<p><strong>– Michael Marquardt</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Cryptocurrency is such a powerful concept that it can almost overturn governments”</p>
<p><strong>– Charles Lee</strong></p></blockquote>

And perhaps if we pool our Dogecoin together we can build a Dogeyacht and sail the world, just saying…!”</p>
<p><strong>– Jackson Palmer</strong></p></blockquote>

Who knows what the future is going suggest to us as money, once we see digital currencies as ordinary?”</p>
<p><strong>– S.E. Sever, Writer</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>– Patrick Young, Financial analyst</strong></p></blockquote>
