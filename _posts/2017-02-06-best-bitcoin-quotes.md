<blockquote><p>In 1999, Professor Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize winner in economics stated:</p>
<p>“I think the internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that’s missing but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash.”</p></blockquote>

<p>– Hal Finney</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Bitcoin enables certain uses that are very unique. I think it offers possibilities that no other currency allows. For example the ability to spend a coin that only occurs when two separate parties agree to spend the coin; with a third party that couldn’t run away with the coin itself.”</p>
<p>– Pieter Wuille</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Hey, obviously this is a very interesting time to be in Bitcoin right now, but if you guys want to argue over whether this is reality or not, one Bitcoin will feed over 40 homeless people in Pensacola right now.

<p>– Jason King</p></blockquote>

<p>– Amir Taaki</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“When I first heard about Bitcoin, I thought it was impossible. How can you have a purely digital currency? Can’t I just copy your hard drive and have your bitcoins? I didn’t understand how that could be done, and then I looked into it and it was brilliant”</p>
<p>– Jeff Garzik</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“As the value goes up, heads start to swivel and skeptics begin to soften. Starting a new currency is easy, anyone can do it. The trick is getting people to accept it, because it is their use that gives the “money” value.”</p>
<p>– Adam B. Levine</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“At its core, bitcoin is a smart currency, designed by very forward-thinking engineers. It eliminates the need for banks, gets rid of credit card fees, currency exchange fees, money transfer fees, and reduces the need for lawyers in transitions1… all good things”</p>
<p>– Peter Diamandis</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Cryptocurrency Protocols Are Like Onions… One common design philosophy among many cryptocurrency 2.0 protocols is the idea that, just like the internet, cryptocurrency design would work best if protocols split off <p>into different layers. Under this strain of thought, Bitcoin is to be thought of as a sort of TCP/IP of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and other next-generation protocols can be built on top of Bitcoin much like we have SMTP for email, HTTP for webpages and XMPP for chat all on top of TCP as a common underlying data layer.”</p>
<p>– Vitalik Buterin</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“The bitcoin world is this new ecosystem where it doesn’t cost that much to start a new bitcoin company, it doesn’t cost much to start owning bitcoin either, and it is a much more efficient way of moving money around the world.”</p>
<p>– Tim Draper</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“I love seeing new services constantly starting to accept Bitcoin. Bitcoin is really becoming “the currency of the Internet.” I’m most concerned by possible government reactions to Bitcoin. They can’t destroy Bitcoin, but they could really slow things down by making exchange much more difficult.”</p>
<p>– Michael Marquardt</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Cryptocurrency is such a powerful concept that it can almost overturn governments”</p>
<p>– Charles Lee</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Spend some time with Bitcoin. Learn it, challenge it, and use it. You can assume no government wants you adopting this system in any capacity, and for that reason alone it’s worth consideration by honest, moral, and industrious people”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Economists and journalists often get caught up in this question: Why does Bitcoin have value? And the answer is very easy. Because it is useful and scarce.” </p>
<p>– Erik Voorhees</p></blockquote>

And perhaps if we pool our Dogecoin together we can build a Dogeyacht and sail the world, just saying…!”</p>
<p>– Jackson Palmer</p></blockquote>

Who knows what the future is going suggest to us as money, once we see digital currencies as ordinary?”</p>
<p>– S.E. Sever, Writer</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I understand the political ramifications of [bitcoin] and I think that government should stay out of them and they should be perfectly legal.”</p>

It’s going to be alternative currencies like bitcoin and it’s not actually going to be a banking system as we had before 2008.”</p>
<p>– Patrick Young, Financial analyst</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“Instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, no fees of any kind, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in the world!”</p>
