<p>Making use of the wallet’s seed phrase is a good way to <a href="/bitcoin-security-standards/">recover your bitcoins</a> in a case where you lose your hardware wallet. The hardware wallets mentioned above can be restored to a brand new device or wallets such as Electrum, Multibit and Mycelium wallets.

<p>For certain situations where you lost your hardware wallet but thinking ahead, you have responsibly kept your backup seed phrase for future purposes to restore the wallet. Like for example with a Trezor device, the private key can be exported to a new Trezor, hence you can just go to their online interface and click the recovery button. </p>

<p>Enter how many words you opt for your seed phrase varying 12-18-24 using your handwritten backup recovery book. When you’re done typing the random words from your seed, pin will be asked and your new device should be ready. </p> 

<p>For Keepkey hardware wallet (other hardware wallets work as well) users, restoration can also be done to Multibit and other wallets. To begin the process of recovery, open the Multibit and click restore within the password interface. Next is choosing what type of hardware wallet Multibit supports when the drop down list appears.</p>

<p>Now, in the order you wrote the <a href="/trezor-review-bitcoin-hardware-wallet/">seed words down</a> enter them and wait to be verified. If the password is already confirmed, a report screen will finish and accessibility to your funds should be at hand any time.</p>

<p>The process is the same with other wallets that support the specific seed phrase. Hence, the method is primarily the same when you restore a Ledger device using a Mycelium wallet. At the start up screen, click “restore backup” upon installation of Mycelium software since users need to fresh install it.</p>

<p>It is important to type each word one at time (all Ledger seed are 24 words) during the restoration process of Mycelium. When it is completed, funds that were kept on your Ledger device can now be transferred. </p>
