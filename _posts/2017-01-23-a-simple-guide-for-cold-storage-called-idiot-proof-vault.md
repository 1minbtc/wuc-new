<p>In the digital assets world, since the price of <a href="/segregated-witness/">bitcoin increases continuously</a>, hence making exchanges and wallet providers more vulnerable to theft, keeping them safe is one of the most vital things to keep in mind. Cold Storage – storing your bitcoins offline, is the best way to keep it safe.</p>
 
<h2>Creating Cold Storage Using a Paper Wallet  </h2>

<p>Cold storage is just like any other practices of storing cryptocurrency offline but in the bitcoin world. Using encrypted devices, a bearer instrument (physical bitcoin), a hard drive or USB drive, a hardware wallet, and a paper wallet, bitcoin users can choose to store their bitcoins.  Paper wallet is one of the most well-known practices since it is significantly low cos and acts as a cash-like device.</p>
 
<p>Now let’s discuss how to start a simple paper wallet for storing digital assets offline. Always double check your steps upon creating a paper wallet since using it still has various vulnerabilities. There are certain steps that can be done to reduce some risks. Start with hiding and keeping your paper wallet out of sight. </p>

<p>Next will be using a good printer that doesn’t make the ink bleed and not connected to the internet as well. Finally, laminating the paper is really a great help as well as keeping it a dry <a href="/introduction-bitcoin-paper-wallets-cold-storage/">fireproof environment</a> since paper can be easily damaged if stored otherwise.</p>
 
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To begin, you will need some bitcoins, a printer and a bitcoin wallet with QR reading potential. We can find a user friendly paper wallet creator in Bitcoin.com’s tool section and it can be done in just a few minutes. Almost the same experience can be offered by other providers for making paper wallets.  </p>

<p>You start by making an address upon accessing our paper wallet creator tool and to achieve this, just move the mouse around the monitor and the application makes a random set of keys.</p>
 
<p>A public and private key will be seen on the monitor by the time the key generator gets to 100 percent. The creation of paper wallet is now ready to be paper printed, bitcoin-filled and can also be added with a BIP38 passphrase which encrypts your paper wallet securing the safety of your funds if wallet is stolen and somehow exposed.  </p>

<p>An attacker needs to type in the paraphrase to get hold of the funds if the user has encrypted the wallet with BIP38 although it is not recommended to use with your first paper wallet except if you’re familiar with the process already. During instances where the passphrase is gone or forgotten, the funds will never be used. </p>

<p>But, on top of securing methods of storing the physical <a href="/bitcoin-scams-how-stay-safe/">paper wallet</a> safely, using BIP38 doubles the layer of protection.  </p>

<p>It is very crucial to keep the private key in a safe place because if someone can get ahold of it, the coins can be spent easily. It is wise to back up your private key because this information is needed to use your funds.</p>
 
<p>The public key can be used in a lot of ways; to put bitcoins into the storage address, to validate funds using block explorer and to make bitcoins sent to you from others by sharing it with them. </p>

<p>A password is required to gain entry to your digital assets if you opted to use BIP38 passphrase to encrypt the paper wallet. Additionally, your private key can be transferred into a p2p client wallet anytime.</p>
 
<h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>

<p>Although it is very easy to make a paper wallet but the most challenging part is making sure to secure the paper responsibly by the use of storage locations that are safe, backing keys up and taking note of your BIP38 passphrase. The most secured way possible of a perfect paper wallet creation is using it for cold storage.</p>
 
 <p><center><img src="/images/a-simple-guide-for-cold-storage-called-idiot-proof-vault/paper.jpg" alt="paper wallet"/></center></p>

 
<p>Paper wallets can be used as a great bearer <a href="/bitcoin-cold-storage/">assurance tool</a> and it can be easily emulated by a person in the aspects of cash with cryptocurrency. Other physical instrument can also be used with the practice explained above like engraving a piece of metal, plastic card printing and storing the keys in your brain if you’re confident enough.</p>
 
<p>Losing bitcoins by mistake won’t be significant if you always start using little amounts of it; hence making it the greatest way to practice improving cold storage. You will get used to and be comfortable with cold storage practices if you spend more time practicing it.</p>
 
<p>Now let’s summarize the procedure. First is going to a paper wallet creator to generate an address. Second, move the mouse to generate random keys. Typing on your keyboard can be done as well. Next is printing after public/private key is created. </p>

<p>Then you can decide to add a BIP38 passphrase, load public address with bitcoins and secure private key in a safe location. Lastly, storing your savings online or giving some bitcoin cash to friends.</p>
