Shadow is a truly unique project, spawned from Bitcoin, over 6 months of development has transformed the pseudoanonymous Bitcoin into the first true anonymous decentralized cryptocurrency — Shadowcash. In traditional financial terms, other cryptocurrencies represent the trackable check or card option, while Shadow is cash. ShadowSend‘s unique zero-knowledge, dual-key stealth address and ring signature protocol enables near-instant, untraceable, unlinkable and trustless transactions.

<h2>Who created and lives in the Shadow?</h2>
Nobody owns the Shadow network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Shadow is controlled and lived in by all Shadow users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Shadow protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Shadow can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.
<h2>How to use Shadow Chat</h2>
An implemented P2P encrypted instant messaging system that uses state-of-the-art technology to keep your communications private.
<p>All messages are encrypted by the proven AES-256-CBC algorithm, and distributed between nodes in such a way as to prevent the recipients of messages from being inferred by assailants utilising sophisticated traffic analysis, even if the assailants can view the entire network and/or run nodes of the network.
<p>To eliminate the risk and hassle of sharing passwords, ShadowChat uses the proven and trusted method of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange. The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used to give you confidence that the messages you receive come from where they claim to.
