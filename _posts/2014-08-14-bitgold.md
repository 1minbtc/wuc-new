<td style="text-align: left;">Users can send and receive gold as payment to and from any BitGold user or seller for free. Gold can be sent as payment to non-BitGold users with email or mobile phone. This does seem like an interesting use case in the Information Age.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 5px solid white;" title="bitgold iphone app" src="/images/bitgold-debit-card.jpg" /></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Users can spend gold with a BitGold prepaid debit card.

Additionally, the feature includes ATM machines to withdraw local currency.</td></tr>

### Is Bitgold safe?
<center><img src="/images/bitgold-going-public.jpg"></center>
<p><a href="http://www.runtogold.com/goldmoney/bitgold-review/">Bitgold</a> is new, unproven and appears to be in a regulatory grey area. The company itself does not appear to state what regulator has jurisdiction and oversees their trade practices such as ensuring that customer funds are kept safe. Additionally, the CEO has endorsed the use of the system with online gambling.
<p>According to <a href="/bitgold-filing.pdf">page 20 of their initial public filing</a> they conclude that:
<blockquote cite="/bitgold-filing.pdf">"neither company is eligible to be registered with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada ... There can be no assurance that BitGold’s services or Internet platform will be acceptable to foreign regulatory bodies. Foreign governments may seek to restrict access to BitGold’s services, block BitGold’s website, or impose other restrictions that may affect BitGold’s ability to offer service to new or existing users in those for an extended period of time or indefinitely.</blockquote>

<p>On May 27, 2015 there was a <a href="https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/bitgold-goldmoney-052720152">very thorough article</a> by Bullionvault CEO Paul Tustain on the Bitgold and Goldmoney merger where he raises very interesting points about the financial stability of the Bitgold and Goldmoney combination and presents a three year comparison chart between Bullionvault and Goldmoney.
<p><blockquote>Those results made scary reading.
<ul><li>GoldMoney's sales have collapsed – by 78.7% over three years.</li>
<li>It lost £9.4 million in just one year – 2014.</li>
<li>Its net assets fell from £25.4m in 2013 to £13.1m in 2015.</li>
<li>At its March 2015 year-end it is still posting losses.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>The financial statements speak for themselves and tell the story of incredible mismanagement at Goldmoney relative to Bullionvault. It will be interesting to see whether the Goldmoney will be turned around via this merger with Bitgold.

<p>On May 29, 2015 Bitgold announced a <a href="http://web.tmxmoney.com/article.php?newsid=75802274&qm_symbol=XAU">CAD$21m bought deal financing</a> which should ally some of the concerns Mr. Tustain raised..
<p>Consequently, while the uncertainty risk from a new service provider may not outweigh the risk of going with a trusted provider like BullionVault the merger with GoldMoney should be taken into account.
### Bitgold CEO endorses use with online gambling
<center><img src="/images/bitgold-roy-sebag.jpg"></center>
From an interview with the <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/investing/bitgold-begins-trading-on-tsx-venture-exchange-as-gold-transaction-platform-builds-momentum">Financial Post</a>:
<blockquote cite="http://business.financialpost.com/investing/bitgold-begins-trading-on-tsx-venture-exchange-as-gold-transaction-platform-builds-momentum">Based on the rapid take-up of the platform in the first few days, he said it appears to be far more than a niche product for a small group of users. He noted that hardcore gold bugs make up less than 10 per cent of the user base so far.
<p>“I’m seeing friends who signed up sending payments to each other,” Sebag said. “I know they bet on football, and now they’re paying each other.”</blockquote>
### Is Bitgold a scam? Opinions by major thought leaders.
<p>There is no evidence of any nefarious or malicious actions being taken by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/20543/bitgold-inc-acquires-goldmoney-com-cad-52-million/">Bitgold</a>.
<p>However, on May 19, 2015, a few days after the IPO, <b>Dominic Frisby</b> <a href="http://moneyweek.com/dont-touch-this-gold-and-bitcoin-combo-with-a-ten-foot-bargepole/">wrote</a>:
<blockquote cite="http://moneyweek.com/dont-touch-this-gold-and-bitcoin-combo-with-a-ten-foot-bargepole/">
<p>Today we consider BitGold. We don’t ask whether you should run away – but how fast. ...
<p>As someone who’s seen what Vancouver is capable of, this has set all my alarm bells off. There’s been a lot of hype and now somebody is selling. There’s an expression for that. ...
<p>Given all this, my view is that BitGold’s founders, Roy Sebag and Josh Crumb, don’t properly understand gold.  ...
<p>If BitGold’s founders knew their bitcoin history, they would not have named the company thus. It is yet another factor that makes me worry that this is little more than a gimmick. ...
<p>In short, there is a huge amount of success already priced in here, based on little more than a superficially persuasive idea. As soon as the hype dies out, a lot of money is going to get made shorting this one – and a lot of money lost by those who were taken in.</blockquote>
<p>On May 29, 2015 Goldmoney founder <b>James Turk</b> responded to Dominic Frisby <a href="http://moneyweek.com/dominic-is-wrong-the-time-is-ripe-for-digital-gold/">here</a>.
<p>On June 28, 2015 <b>Michael Shedlock [Mish]</b> of the popular Global Economic Analysis blog wrote a very thorough opinion on Bitgold including:
<p><blockquote cite="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2015/06/bitgold-now-available-in-us-why-bitgold.html">I encourage everyone to Sign Up for a BitGold Account. I have done so myself. ...
<p>Due to my long-standing relationship with GoldMoney, many readers have asked what the purchase of GoldMoney by BitGold means.
<p>After careful review over the past couple weeks with both James Turk, founder of GoldMoney, and Roy Sebag, the co-founder of BitGold, I am pleased to report the news is 100% positive. ...
<p>Seldom does one plus one equal three, but that idea makes sense here. I back promotion of gold as a currency, and BitGold has the resources and institutional backing to do it properly. Attempts by others have failed or languished.</blockquote>
### Conclusion
<p>Potential customers should keep in mind that this is a new and unproven service provider with significant legal questions that do not appear to be definitively answered with a CEO who actively endorses its use for highly regulated activities like online gambling.
<p>It would be unfortunate if this ended up like e-Gold which resulted in the <a href="http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/digital-currencies-led-biggest-money-laundering-case-ever-bitcoin-74083">largest digital currency money laundering case of all time</a> or MtGox where <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/20030/kraken-accepting-mtgox-bankruptcy-claims-and-giving-free-trade-credit/">customers lost approximately $500m of funds</a>.
