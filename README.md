# For Other Language Versions

### For Web developers / Designers / Translators

Each localized version of weusecoins is independent of each other and use static HTML, CSS or PHP files.

That allows us to adapt to best fit each language's requirements, available resources, local businesses or active groups. That includes the HTML, fonts, CSS, scripts, social networks, etc. and allows us to update other languages when a translator is missing for a specific language.

The materials directory is used as a shared directory to store files that take significant disk space like videos.

Please help fix any broken links, bugs, typos, grammatical errors, etc.

Thanks!

### What Not To Do

For obvious reasons, you should not change the meaning of any text or add or change links. Such changes must be discussed first.
You are can add links to community or news websites in the community section that might be appropriate for each language.

### Keep the Same HTML Structure

Please keep HTML structure as symetric and perfectly identical as possible between each page and each localized version. This should not prevent adding unique things for some languages. But please keep the rest as close as possible. This helps keep consistency.
