April 1st 2015 the Isle of Man's Bitcoin specific legislation, the <a href="/assets/pdf/proceeds-of-crime-act-isle-of-man-bitcoin.pdf">Proceeds of Crime Act</a>, went into effect which has created a very friendly environment for legitimate businesses on the island and was specifically tailored to (1) protect customer funds and (2) keep crime out.
