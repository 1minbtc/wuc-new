Roger Ver, sometimes known as _Bitcoin Jesus_ or controversially [Bitcoin Anti-Christ](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/roger-ver-from-bitcoin-jesus-to-bitcoin-antichrist-69fc7a17c622), is the owner of Bitcoin.com, and an investor in many of the world's largest Bitcoin companies. He started investing in bitcoins in early 2011 and bought his first bitcoins at around $1.00.

Roger is an ex-convict. He was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison for a felony involving selling explosives on Ebay.

## Bitcoin.com

Ver owns the Bitcoin.com domain name. He originally rented out the domain to Chinese Bitcoin exchange OKCoin. After an argument over payments and terms of the agreements, Ver took back control of the site. 

Since then, Ver has updated the Bitcoin.com site to include information on getting started with Bitcoin, a forum and a news section. 

## MemoryDealers

Ver founded MemoryDealers in 1999. The company sells computer hardware, memory, and routers for low prices. 

## Investments
